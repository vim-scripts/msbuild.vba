This Vim plugin enables syntax support for all typical MSBuild project and include files matching the following patterns:

    *.*proj
    *.props
    *.targets

You can also build an open project from within Vim using :make. Any warnings or errors can then be opened directly. You can also pass command line parameters to :make like you would to msbuild.exe, like:

    :make /t:rebuild

Some items and imported projects or targets can also be opened with gf. Any environment variables in the path are expanded automatically if possible.
